 *  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 *  source, and configuration files.
 *  
 *  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 *  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 *  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 *  and conversions to other media types.
 *  
 *  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 *  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 *  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 *  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 *  
 *  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 *  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 *  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 *  
 *  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 *  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 *  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

 *  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
 *  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 *  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 *  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

 *  
 *  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 *  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 *  subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 *  
 *  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 *  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 *  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 *  
 *  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 *  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 *  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 *  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *  as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *  
 *  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *  meet the following conditions:
 *  
 *  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *  
 *  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *  stating that You changed the files; and
 *  
 *  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *  the Derivative Works; and
 *  
 *  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *  as modifying the License.
 *  
 *  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *  the conditions stated in this License.
 *  
 *  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *  
 *  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *  
 *  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *  
 *  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *  
 *  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *  
 *  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *  
 *  APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *  
 *  To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *  boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
 *  replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
 *  the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
 *  comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
 *  file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
 *  same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
 *  identification within third-party archives.
